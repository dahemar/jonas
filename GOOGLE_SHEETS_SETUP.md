## üñºÔ∏è Image Management

### Supported Formats
- WebP (recommended for best performance)
- JPG/JPEG
- PNG

### Image Organization
- Blog images: `blog/` folder
- Works images: `works/WORKS/`, `works/COMMISSIONS/`, `works/EXHIBITIONS/`
- Commercial images: `commercial/` folder

### Image URLs
Use relative paths with simple numbers:
- `blog/1.webp`
- `works/WORKS/2.webp`
- `works/COMMISSIONS/3.webp`
- `works/EXHIBITIONS/4.webp`
- `commercial/5.webp`

**Note:** All images use `loading="lazy"` for optimization.

## üîÑ How It Works

1. Website loads
2. JavaScript fetches data from Google Sheets
3. Content is dynamically generated
4. No code changes needed for content updates
5. Email and Instagram handles in the contact section are clickable

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Keep image URLs consistent with folder structure
- Use WebP format for best performance
- Test changes by refreshing the website
- API has rate limits (1000 requests per 100 seconds)
- Keep spreadsheet publicly viewable
