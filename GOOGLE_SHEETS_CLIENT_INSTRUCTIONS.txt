GOOGLE SHEETS CONTENT MANAGEMENT
===============================

You can update all the content on your website using a single Google Sheet. No coding or GitHub access is needed. Just follow these instructions:

1. OPEN THE GOOGLE SHEET
------------------------
- Link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RTrPB8qONlXQG37mRzPJ8aanTlxLGLy3MeYpsyKnmBk/edit?usp=sharing

2. HOW TO UPDATE CONTENT
------------------------
- Each tab at the bottom of the Google Sheet controls a different part of your website: Blog, Works, Commissions, Exhibitions, Music, Radio, Contact, Commercial
- Each row is an item (e.g., a blog post, a work, a music project).
- Each column is a property (e.g., image, title, description).
- You can leave any field empty if you don't want to display it.

3. ADDING IMAGES (GOOGLE DRIVE)
-------------------------------
To add images to your website, upload them to Google Drive and use the direct link in the Google Sheet:
1. Upload your image to Google Drive.
2. Right-click the image and select "Get link". Set to "Anyone with the link can view".
3. Copy the file ID from the link (the long string after /d/ and before /view).
4. In your Google Sheet, paste the following format in the image column:
   https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=YOUR_FILE_ID
5. That's it! The image will appear on your website after you refresh the page.
